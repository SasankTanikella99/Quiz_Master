Project Name: "QuizMaster"

Project Description:
"QuizMaster" is a complex quiz platform, which follows the microservices concept using Spring Boot, Maven and Java 17. This system helps individuals to participate in several quizzes that have different questions but communicate efficiently through HTTP over various components.

Key Features:
Microservices Architecture: “QuizMaster” incorporates the microservices design principle where there are individual services for user management, question management, quiz management, API Gateway as well as service registration. The scalable, flexible and maintainable nature of this architecture makes it the most ideal one.

User Management: The user service is responsible for dealing with registration of users, their authentication and profile management all these being aimed at enhancing personalization on part of the users.

Question Service: This service encompasses the creation of queries in addition to the retrieval and modification related to questions that will be included in a questionnaire. It has a dedicated database that stores only question data; hence maintaining integrity and consistency of information.

Quiz Service: It involves creating quizzes as well as managing them throughout their lifetime. In addition, it interacts with question service to fetch questions from it and arrange necessary steps towards conducting the quiz contest itself.

API Gateway: It acts as an entry point for requests from clients by routing them into appropriate micro-services recognizing that they may not share common APIs due to differences in functions offered by microservices themselves.

Service Registry: A registry of available microservices is maintained centrally, which allows for service discovery on the fly and ensures smooth communication between services

Detailed Documentation: Each microservice has detail documentation on Design, Implementation and Deployment in “QuizMaster” apart from guidelines for Developers and Administrators.

With a modular structure, strong functionality, and extensive documentation, “QuizMaster” provides a scalable and dependable venue to host quizes as well as engage users in interactive learning experiences.
